			This is a quick summary of the public beliefs I find important about 
			reality, knowledge, ethics, politics, economics, ecology and free speech. 
			Please share if you think it’s worthy.
			<br><br>
			<b>Reality.</b> 
			Reality is a generator of events that we measure indirectly. Perhaps 
			they are caused by the interactions of little particles and forces 
			born out of fields, or perhaps by a vast symphony of tiny strings, 
			who knows? (nobody knows). Assume that’s enough, apply the principle 
			of parsimony and that’s that. Keep your metaphysics as empty as possible. 
			No invisible or intangible stuff, no 
			gods, miracles or anything else supernatural. No magic.
			<br><br>
			<b>Knowledge</b>. 
			The beliefs we hold about reality are not reality itself. The map is 
			not the territory. Molded by natural selection, human brains have a 
			hard time dealing with complex stuff. Our brains are lazy, they use 
			many biases and sloppy ways of thinking. We are fueled by and 
			hungry for metaphors. Human senses are limited in number, scope and 
			precision. To prevent these failings, support your beliefs with 
			evidence, make experiments, put them, and yourself, to the test. 
			Adapt, adjust. 
			Most beliefs are not ready for public discussion, so be your own 
			worst critic. Be an active skeptic: doubt everything you feel you 
			need to but also search for answers. Stating that a belief is true 
			is an approximation that might change with new evidence. We always 
			deal with degrees of belief, certainties and absolutes are ideals 
			that you should avoid. 
            Keep your mind open but enforce a strict door policy. Do not just 
			accept any explanation or prediction, check for coherence with 
			previous knowledge: demand extraordinary evidence to consider 
			extraordinary claims. The scientific method has proven to be 
			quite efficient at producing true justified beliefs: most scientific 
			core beliefs are already way beyond any reasonable doubt (like 
			natural selection). But science is not the only game in town: try 
			always to learn more about Art, Critical Thinking, History, Math, 
			Philosophy, Statistics. Learning, like exercise, is hard but 
			healthy.
			<br><br>
			<b>Ethics</b>. 
			Refuse violence except in defense of violent acts (please, include 
			animals). Do not (be the first to) break a promise, think first 
			before making one. Don’t lie but don’t forget there usually are 
			gentle ways of telling the truth. When possible, give more and take 
			less. Be impartial. Consider the perspective of the Universe, not 
			just your own side. We really are all in this together. Emotions and 
			thoughts are morally neutral: think and feel what you want. Actions 
			say more about us than our beliefs and words and, except if you are 
			famous, they matter more. The practice of virtue make us virtuous, 
			so practice a lot. Try to live a worthy life, its meaning is up to 
			you. Be nice.
			<br><br>
			<b>Politics</b>. 
			Every person has fundamental rights, but none is inviolable (rights 
			do tend to conflict with each other). People and their cultures are 
			more important than any institution, including nations. Ditto for 
			ecosystems. Fight to live in a society where all citizens are equal 
			before the law. Only laws without prejudice and discrimination that 
			promote/defend ethical behavior or fundamental rights might be 
			worthy of respect. Justice must be impartial, independent, 
			indiscriminate, with known and limited scope of action (this is the 
			Rule of Law). Do not accept victimless crimes. Corporativism and 
			corporations will always promote unjust policies according to their 
			own agenda. Distrust people with strong interests in any type of 
			corporation, especially political (like parties and governments), 
			religious and financial ones. Expect bureaucracy and corruption but 
			don’t resign with either. Keep yourself vigilant, sometimes 
			dangerous ideas influence powerful people. Don’t forget that the 
			right to vote implies the right to be elected (if it doesn’t, you 
			are not living in a democracy) and that a majority rule doesn’t mean 
			a tyranny of the majority. As much freedom as possible is a 
			desirable thing but it increases your responsibility (you can handle 
			it). Be tolerant except in the defense of tolerance:
            tolerance does not mean meekness. Promote the secular education of 
			every child. Let me say this last one again:
			<i>promote the secular education of every child</i>
			<br><br>
			<b>Economics</b>. 
			Economics, like Ethics, is an exercise over limited resources. The 
			Earth is finite. Exponential growth is unsustainable, only 
			ideological blindness thinks otherwise. The feedback of our 
			decisions take time but they will come and many are unpredictable. For 
			each credit there’s a debt and a due date. Future generations will 
			gladly receive any benefits we leave but they should not pay our 
			bills. Energy is not money. There’s no such thing as a rational agent: information and 
			decision are expensive, values are subjective and people do influence people in strange 
			ways. Refuse monopolies and avoid centralized governments. 
			Bankruptcy is nasty but no bankruptcies is nastier. Don’t 
			underestimate self-organization. However, markets are just the best 
			solution to specific problems (where information is available, 
			similar price and quality products, diversity of supply/demand, not 
			relevant externalities, ...). Without most of these conditions, don’t expect 
			markets to solve your problem. On the other hand, States do have a 
			mediocre historical success record (History didn't reset after World 
			War II). Everything has diminishing 
			returns, the margin counts more than you think. There’s no miraculous 
			technological solution ahead, no single straight answer to every 
			problem. Yes, ideology sucks. Don’t think you can wish away 
			externalities and risks. Nor Physics. There are no free lunches 
			(check 'no magic' above).
            <br><br>
			<b>Ecology</b>. 
			Humans are just another species, deeply tied together with almost all the 
			others. This is the ecosystem we evolved into, think twice before 
			each decision to simplify or destroy it. Every action has unintended 
			consequences, some of them are costly in economic and ecological 
			terms. Study nature’s solutions: the Ecosphere weeded out lots of 
			bad solutions over the eons and has a delicate balance that should 
			be respected before trying to mess with it. Economy is a subset of 
			the ecosystem. Every decision, every attempt to change and grow, has 
			a cost and part of it cannot be accounted. You always pay something 
			to do something else. Both nature's capacity and heritage are 
			finite. Don’t think the garbage you dump away just disappears.
			<br><br>
			<b>Free Speech</b>. 
			Beliefs don’t have rights. When entering the public domain, they are 
			faced with constant criticism and need of defense, they should never 
			be imposed on others by force. So if you are not up for it, keep 
			your private beliefs to yourself (thank you). People should be 
			respected because they are people, beliefs don’t have that status. 
			Refuse censorship, dogma, arbitrary prohibitions, personal attacks. 
			Promote free speech and critical thinking, how to listen, to 
			dialogue and to question. Be just and impartial when criticizing, 
			and give the position you disagree the best possible interpretation. 
			It’s not easy but respect logic when arguing. Make yourself clear 
			(the world is already full of empty discussions) and don’t get stuck 
			on words while arguing (taboo them if you must). There’s no right to 
			not be offended but one should be able to use the judicial system to 
			answer slander or libel. Never forget the power of humor, of irony and 
			sarcasm. Ideas have authors, not owners. The public domain is the 
			source of all human ideas and inventions, of all our achievements. 
			It truly is more important than any conflicting economic right. A 
			free Internet is, together with education and voting, one of the 
			most powerful social and political tools that common people ever had 
			and should be cherished, fought for and celebrated.
